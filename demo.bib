	Language models (LMs) are essential components of many applications such as speech recognition or machine translation. LMs factorize the probability of a string of words into a product of P(w 
	
	i 
	|h 
	
	i 
	), where h 
	
	i 
	is the context (history) of word w 
	
	i 
	. Most LMs use previous words as the context. The paper presents two alternative approaches: post-ngram LMs (which use following words as context) and dependency LMs (which exploit dependency structure of a sentence and can use e.g. the governing word as context). Dependency LMs could be useful whenever a topology of a dependency tree is available, but its lexical labels are unknown, e.g. in tree-to-tree machine translation. In comparison with baseline interpolated trigram LM both of the approaches achieve significantly lower perplexity for all seven tested languages (Arabic, Catalan, Czech, English, Hungarian, Italian, Turkish).

	abstract="This paper describes details of the evaluation experiments for questions created by an automatic question generation system. Given a target word and one of its word senses, the system generates a multiple-choice English vocabulary question asking for the closest in meaning to the target word in the reading passage. Two kinds of evaluation were conducted considering two aspects: (1) measuring English learners' proficiency and (2) their similarity to the human-made questions. The first evaluation is based on the responses from English learners obtained through administering the machine-generated and human-made questions to them, and the second is based on the subjective judgement by English teachers. Both evaluations showed that the machine-generated questions were able to achieve a comparable level with the human-made questions in both measuring English proficiency and similarity.",
